#Assignment 1

##milestone 3

##Overview
The purpose of this miletone is to Complete my app and make it a fully polished app, making sure it has a home screen icon and, for example, that it displays a loading indicator while its data are being loaded. I updated my Checklist app for milestone 3 using the milestones from the prior weeks. In addition to the previous requirements, it is now possible to add, delete, rename, and reset checklists on the Master View (checklistsView) and items on the Detail View (ItemsView) from the previous milestone while in Edit mode. Additionally, a regular swipe gesture can be used to delete an item from the Master and Detail Views without first pressing Edit. Importantly, JSON serialisationÂ now ensures that all data is permanent.

##In Milestone 3 I learnt:
.Create data model and view in swiftUI
.creation of a navigation view and navigation link
.implementation of binding variables and state variables
.creation of global function 
.how to move and delete from lists without edit mode
.how to create lists of lists
.loading and saving data into a "JSON" file, and JSON serialisation
.the transition between views 
.how to write to file and save using onappear and ondissappear functions

##For MILESTONE 2 I implemented:
Created Classes for Checklist and items in checklists and created a class for data model for MVVM.
Using the functions in datamodel for jason serialisation to load and save data from file
